 <p> <img src="images/m.png" alt="M"> any geographers are trained in 
    toponymy and cartology, this is not 
    their main preoccupation. Geographers 
    study the space and the temporal database
     distribution of phenomena, processes, and 
     features as well as the interaction of humans and 
     their environment. Because space and place affect a 
     variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, 
     plants and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary.
      The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach 
      depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between
     physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.</p>

        <h2>Integrated Geography</h2>
        <p>Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into 
        two main subsidiary fields: human geography and physical 
        geography. The former largely focuses on the built 
        environment and how humans create, view, manage, and 
        influence space. The latter examines the natural environment,
         and how organisms, climate, soil, water,
         and landforms produce and interact</p>
     </div>
     <div class="text3">
        <p>The difference between these approaches led to a third 
        field, environmental geography, which combines 
        physical and human geography and concerns 
        the interactions 
        between the environment and humans.</p>

            the 9th century BC depicted Babylon as being further

           <p>The Oldest Known World Maps</p>
           <p>The oldest known world maps date back to ancient Babylon from the 9th century BC. The best known Babylonian world map, however, is the Imago Mundi of 600 BC. The map as reconstructed by Eckhard Unger shows Babylon on the Euphrates, surrounded by a circular landmass showing Assyria, Urartu and several cities, in turn surrounded by a "bitter river" (Oceanus), with seven islands arranged around it so as to form a seven-pointed star.</p>

           <p>The Ideas of Anaximander</p>
           <p>The ideas of Anaximander: considered by later Greek writers to be the true founder of geography, come to us through fragments quoted by his successors. Anaximander is credited with the invention of the gnomon, the simple, yet efficient Greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of latitude. Thales is also credited with the prediction of eclipses. The foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures, such as the ancient, medieval, and early modern Chinese.</p>

      <p>The Greeks, who were the first to explore geography as both art and 
        science, achieved this through Cartography, Philosophy, and Literature, or 
        through Mathematics. There is some debate about who was the first person to 
        assert that the Earth is spherical in shape, with the credit going either to 
        Parmenides or Pythagoras. Anaxagoras was able to demonstrate that the profile 
        of the¬†Earth was circular by explaining eclipses. However, he still believed that 
        the¬†Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries.</p> <br>
            <p>The first rigorous system of latitude and longitude 
            lines is credited to Hipparchus. He employed a sexagesimal 
            system that was derived from Babylonian mathematics.</p>
